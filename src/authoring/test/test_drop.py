"""
Test the drop action. Gripper should move to the specified position and release. However, the gripper
won't directly move to it, but rather move to a pre-drop position which is 8cm above the drop position,
then move IMMEDIATELY to the drop position. Once it released, it will return to the pre-drop 
position.
Not like place, the drop action put down things quickly.
