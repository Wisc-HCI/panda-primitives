"""
Test the move_unknown action. The robot will first execute a PICK action to grasp an unknown object at a 
specified position, then execute PLACE action to put down it at a specified position.

Unknown object means that the object is not in the robot's database and the robot will handle it in a 
general way. For example, no matter what the container is, the robot will just place it.
