"""
Tests untwisting a large bolt ~1 rotation with the UNTWIST command.
Bolt need to be placed at (x,y,z) = (0.52, 0, -0.24). You can eyeball
this as the place where the gripper first goes down before closing.

Note: If the gripper does not grasp the bolt, it will "reset" without
doing any twisting.
