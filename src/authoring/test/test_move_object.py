"""
Test the move_object action. The robot will first execute a PICK action to grasp a known object at a 
specified position, then execute PLACE action to put down it at a specified position.

known object means that the object is already in the robot's database and the robot knows how to handle
it. For example, if the place where the robot puts down the object is a box, the robot will just drop it 
instead of placing it.
